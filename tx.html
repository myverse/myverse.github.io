Hello,
I am Wang Baiqiang, I'm new here and I very look forward to working with you！
Before i join CITI, I have two work experiences. The first one was in Zhaolian Consumer finance company，I entered zhaolian as soon as I graduated, and worked in Zhaolilan about three years. The second experience was in a founding-team for about two years, it was a meaningful experience for me because I have left my own product on the Internet,althought it was very small.
And now, I am in my third experience. Actually, when I first knew CITI was in my first year in College. The launching ceremony of "Citi Cup" financial innovation and application competition was held in my College, since then, I have wondered when I can join CITI, now I make it. 
I majored in software engineering in University, and I love reading and like to try something new, I'm looking forward to create a exciting experience and make progress together in citi. 
Thank you!
